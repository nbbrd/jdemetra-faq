## Known issues

* Starting with **Java SE 8**, the JDBC-ODBC Bridge is [no longer included with the JDK](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/bridge.html).  
Therefore, the **ODBC provider is disabled** when running on this version. It is recommend to use a JDBC driver provided by the vendor of your database or a commercial JDBC Driver instead of the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.
