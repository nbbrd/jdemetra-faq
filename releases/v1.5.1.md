## Files

* [OS-independent archive](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/eu/europa/ec/joinup/sat/nbdemetra-app/1.5.1/nbdemetra-app-1.5.1.zip)

## Known issues

* Starting with **Java SE 8**, the JDBC-ODBC Bridge is [no longer included with the JDK](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/bridge.html).  
Therefore, the **ODBC provider is disabled** when running on this version. It is recommend to use a JDBC driver provided by the vendor of your database or a commercial JDBC Driver instead of the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.
* The 64bit version of the JDBC-ODBC Bridge [throws exceptions randomly](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8038751).  
Therefore, the **ODBC provider is disabled** when running in 64bit.
